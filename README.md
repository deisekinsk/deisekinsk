🌐 Working with technology implies being in a competitive professional market. According to CNN Brasil¹, only 12.3% of women work in this sector.

👩🏾‍💻 I am a technology professional with experience in tech education and multimedia production. I completed my degree in Analysis and Systems Development and my professional internship in December 2023. I am seeking a position as a Junior Software Engineer or Junior Java Back end Developer, preferably remote. I am a mother, Black, from a peripheral area, and an academic. I emphasize my personal skills of curiosity, creativity, focus, and planning. I invite you to check out my progress on the GIT repository: https://github.com/deisekinsk 💡🧠 🚀

How about we engage in a conversation? I have the potential to make a meaningful impact!🎯 #remoteFirst
